<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>I am Pransu Mishra, a passionate web developer and a dedicated MCA student at Galgotias University. 
  My journey in the tech world began with a strong foundation in computer science, having completed my 
  10th in 2019 and 12th in 2021. Currently, I am enhancing my knowledge and skills in web technologies 
  and software development, while residing in Noida with my roots in Kanpur.</p>

<p>As a versatile developer, I have hands-on experience with multiple programming languages including
  Java (my core language), Python, C, as well as front-end technologies like HTML, CSS. My problem-
  solving skills are sharpened through regular practice of DSA problems on LeetCode, where I consistently 
  work on improving my algorithms and coding logic. I have built a solid understanding of both core and 
  advanced programming concepts..</p>

<p>I am driven by a deep curiosity to create innovative solutions and contribute to real-world projects. 
  With my strong technical skills, academic background, and continuous learning mindset, I aim to build 
  impactful web applications and software systems. I am always eager to collaborate on challenging projects 
  and expand my knowledge in the dynamic world of technology.</p>
